// D3D11 -> D3D12 NGX bridge.
//
// The game drives DLSS through NVSDK_NGX_D3D11_EvaluateFeature_C. That call is
// intercepted and forwarded untouched, then this bridge reproduces the same
// contract on a second NGX session running on its own D3D12 device. RenoDX's
// DLSS 5 add-on detours the D3D12 entry points, so the D3D12 evaluate is where
// its neural-rendering pass is inserted.
//
// Per frame:
//   1. copy the game's Color / Depth / MotionVectors into shared textures
//   2. signal a shared fence on the D3D11 immediate context
//   3. wait on it from the D3D12 queue, run the D3D12 evaluate, signal back
//   4. wait on the D3D11 context, copy the result into the game's Output
//
// The textures are created on the D3D12 side with D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_SHARED and
// opened as D3D11 aliases, because the game's own textures carry MiscFlags = 0
// and cannot be shared directly.
